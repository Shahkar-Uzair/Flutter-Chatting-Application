## My Goal

The objective is to incorporate Firebase into our Flutter apps. I'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip my app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. 

## What I will create

I'm going to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
